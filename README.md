<h1> Song Lyric Analyser Shiny App</h1>

This is a lightweight implementation of the [Song Lyric Analyser](https://github.com/CocoUK/SongAnalyser_API/blob/master/README.md) in a [Shiny App](https://cocouk.shinyapps.io/Artist_Lyrics_Analyser/).   

The user selects an artist from the dropdown menu and number of songs to be analysed. The app displays the average number of words and displays a word cloud.
  
<h1> Files </h1>

The script for the App is split into three files:

* Server.R  
* ui.R
* global.R
You can download these into your system and run the app locally.

<h1> Things to do </h1>
There are a lot of things to do to make this project nicer:

* Include more artists on the dropdown menu
* Extracting lyrics from a different database (genius for example)
* Comparing artists
* Add cache system to check previous searches
* Make the App faster
* Include more statistics

and of course, more testing!
